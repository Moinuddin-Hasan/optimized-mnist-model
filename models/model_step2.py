Target:
Based on the analysis from Step 1, the primary target here is to solve the parameter count problem while improving model stability and accuracy. The goals are:
1.  Drastically reduce model parameters to well below 8,000 by completely removing the fully-connected layers and replacing them with a Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer.
2.  Introduce Batch Normalization to stabilize training, accelerate convergence, and act as a regularizer.
3.  Add Dropout to further combat overfitting.
4.  Push test accuracy above 99.25% as a result of a more efficient and regularized architecture. This is the correct "in order" step because architectural efficiency must be addressed before fine-tuning.

Result:
- Test Accuracy: 99.38%
- Parameters: 7,888
- Epochs to reach peak: 17

Analysis:
This step was highly successful in meeting its targets.
1.  **Parameter Count**: Replacing the FC layers with GAP and a final conv layer was extremely effective, reducing parameters from 16.8k to just under 7.9k, meeting the constraint.
2.  **Performance**: Adding Batch Normalization and Dropout significantly improved performance. The model is more stable and achieves a much higher accuracy of 99.38%, very close to the final target.
3.  **Epochs**: The model still requires around 17 epochs to consistently hit its peak, which is just over the 15-epoch limit. The architecture is now sound, but the training process needs to be faster. The final step must focus on accelerating convergence.

Target:
The model architecture from Step 2 is efficient (<8k params) and effective (>99.3% accuracy). The final challenge is to meet the remaining two constraints: consistent 99.4% accuracy within just 15 epochs.
My targets are:
1.  Implement Data Augmentation (slight rotation) to create a more robust model that generalizes better and avoids one-off accuracy spikes, ensuring consistency.
2.  Introduce a powerful Learning Rate Scheduler (OneCycleLR) to accelerate training convergence, allowing the model to reach its peak performance faster.
This is the final optimization step, as these are training techniques used to fine-tune an already well-designed architecture.

Result:
- Test Accuracy: Consistently **99.4% - 99.51%** in epochs 10-15.
- Parameters: 7,888 (unchanged)
- Epochs: 15

Analysis:
All target conditions have been successfully met. This combination represents the final, optimized solution.
1.  **Data Augmentation**: This was key to achieving *consistent* high accuracy. By showing the model slightly varied images, it became more robust and its performance in the final epochs was stable.
2.  **OneCycleLR Scheduler**: This was the critical component for meeting the epoch constraint. It allowed for a higher initial learning rate which dramatically sped up convergence, enabling the model to reach peak performance well within the 15-epoch budget.
The systematic approach of first building an efficient architecture (Step 2) and then applying advanced training techniques (Step 3) was essential to achieving all goals.

Receptive Field Calculation:
